- [x] Server-side integration - 5 jbs
- [x] Client-side integration - 5 jbs
- [ ] Resolve internal issues (optional but important for the future) - 6 jbs
   
    * Not all internal issues were resolved, such as:
        * Display "Select Flower" dropdown menu **after** selecting bed from sidebar 
     
        
- [x] Logo - 1 jb
- [ ] Show comments on the bottom of the flower page - 9 jbs
    
 
   * Not fully functional     
       * Takes time for database to store comment
       * Database is sending data back before it stores the comment it just received causing display problems
         
- [x] Create dropdown menu that collapses - 5 jbs
- [x] Make a separate bed page (distinct to flower pages) (optional) - 8 jbs
